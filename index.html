            <p> When Iâm not diving into a project or chasing down my next big idea, youâll probably find me out
                helping others through various means, getting lost in code, or 3D
                printing designs just for the fun of it. Iâm a big fan of late-night Quiz Bowl practices, gym
                sessions that actually energize me, and spending quality time with friends and family (preferably
                over food,
                laughs, or both). I wear my New York sports pride loud and proud; go Giants, Knicks, and Yankees!
                And
                if you challenge me to anything Nintendo or PokÃ©mon-related... fair warning: I take that very
                seriously!

                    <p>The goal of this project was to introduce the fundamentals of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and
                        Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) through hands-on experience with a <b>Prusa MINI+ 3D
                            Printer</b>
                        and <b>PrusaSlicer software</b>. The project was divided into three parts:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Creating and printing a customized nametag</b> using PrusaSlicer </li>
                        <li><b>Printing a second, more challenging test print</b> (a torture test) to explore the
                            limits of
                            3D printing.</li>
                        <li><b>Documenting the process on a personal website</b> to reflect on the learning
                            experience.
                    </ol>
                    <p>By completing this project, I gained the ability to slice and print 3D models, understand the
                        <b>technical constraints of additive manufacturing</b>, and improve <b>troubleshooting
                            techniques</b> for common 3D printing issues.

                    <p>The goal of Project #2 was to remix existing 3D models by combining elements from different
                        designs,
                        modifying them using 3D modeling software, and printing the final models. This project was
                        divided
                        into two parts: using TinkerCad for remixing and using Fusion360 for more advanced
                        modifications.
                        The objective was to explore 3D modeling, enhance design skills, and gain hands-on
                        experience with
                        3D printing processes.

                    <p><b>Concept & Design Process</b></p>
                    <p>
                        For the first part of this project, I decided to recreate a visual representation of my <a
                            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/58fc0o/a_horse_is_sitting_at_home_watching_mtv/">favorite
                            joke </a> âA horse walks into a bar. The bartender says, âWhy the long face?'â To bring
                        this
                        concept to life, I planned to combine a horse model with a bar model using TinkerCad. I
                        initially
                        sketched out my design, but I found that my proportions were off because I started with
                        the horse rather than defining the 3D environment first. To streamline the process, I opted
                        to
                        download an .stl file of Moeâs Tavern from <i>The Simpsons</i> as my bar model, which
                        allowed me to
                        focus on placing the horse correctly within the scene.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>TinkerCad Modeling Process</b></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Importing .stl Files</b>: I sourced a 3D horse model and a Moeâs Tavern model from
                            Thingiverse and imported them into TinkerCad.</li>
                        <li><b>Alignment & Scaling</b>: Initially, I had difficulty positioning the horse inside the
                            tavern
                            because my snap grid was set to 1mm. After turning the snap grid off, I gained finer
                            control
                            over object placement.</li>
                        <li><b>Modifications</b>: To ensure a proper fit, I adjusted the scale of the horse and
                            tweaked the
                            dimensions of the tavernâs doorway. I also removed unnecessary walls and adjusted the
                            modelâs
                            orientation for printing efficiency.</li>
                        <li><b>Grouping & Exporting</b>: Once I finalized the positioning, I grouped the elements in
                            TinkerCad and exported the final .stl file.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><b>3D Printing Process</b></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Importing to PrusaSlicer</b>: I imported the .stl file into PrusaSlicer and adjusted
                            the
                            scale slightly to fit within the printerâs build volume.</li>
                        <li><b>Support Structures</b>: Since the design had overhanging parts, I added support
                            structures to
                            ensure the printâs structural integrity.</li>
                        <li><b>Printing</b>: I initiated the print and monitored the process for any errors or
                            warping.</li>
                        <li><b>Post-Processing</b>: After printing, I removed the supports carefully. However, I
                            noticed
                            some rough edges where the supports had been attached. More precise removal tools or
                            finer
                            support settings in PrusaSlicer could have improved the post-processing quality.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><b>Resluts and Observations</b></p>
                    <p>
                        The final print successfully represented the joke, with the horse positioned within the bar.
                        The
                        overall print quality was satisfactory, though I could have optimized the support removal
                        process to
                        reduce imperfections. Additionally, adjusting the modelâs orientation before slicing could
                        have
                        improved print efficiency and reduced filament waste.

                    <p>
                        For the second part of the project, I decided to create a functional, auto-opening PokÃ©Ball.
                        I found
                        inspiration from a<a
                            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1cyjzkr/made_this_3dprintable_autoopening_pok%C3%A9_ball/">
                            Reddit post </a> that had a similar design and chose to personalize it by adding my
                        nickname,
                        "Cam," to the top half of the PokÃ©Ball.

                    <p><b>Fusion360 Modeling Process</b></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Importing .stl Files</b>: I downloaded the PokÃ©Ball model components from the
                            aformentioned
                            tutorial.</li>
                        <li><b>Design Adjustments</b>: Initially, I attempted to assemble multiple components in
                            Fusion360
                            but faced difficulties in merging them effectively. Based on advice from Ben and Ian, I
                            shifted
                            my approach to modifying a single component rather than assembling multiple parts.</li>
                        <li><b>Mesh Conversion</b>: To engrave my name into the top of the PokÃ©Ball, I first had to
                            convert
                            the imported mesh into a solid body.</li>
                        <li><b>Adding the Name</b>: Using Fusion360âs text tool and following an online tutorial, I
                            debossed
                            my nickname "Cam" into the surface of the top half of the PokÃ©Ball. While I originally
                            considered an embossed design, I found the debossed look more aesthetically pleasing and
                            easier
                            to print.</li>

                            added
                            supports for the overhanging sections.</li>
                        <li><b>Printing the Top Half</b>: The print quality was good overall, but the very top of
                            the
                            PokÃ©Ball's hemisphere did not print completely. Thankfully, this issue was minimal and
                            did not
                            impact the functionality of the PokÃ©Ball.</li>
                        <li><b>Printing the Other Components</b>: I proceeded to print the remaining components and
                            followed
                            the assembly steps outlined in the tutorial.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><b>Resluts and Observations</b></p>
                    <p>
                        The final product was a fully functional PokÃ©Ball that opens and closes with a button press.
                        The
                        debossed name on the top half turned out well, adding a unique, personal touch to the
                        design. The
                        minor issue with the top hemisphere could have been avoided by slightly increasing the
                        infill
                        percentage or adjusting the print orientation.

                                <p class="text-center">To begin the design process for the chassis enclosure, my
                                    partner,
                                    Vivian, and I brainstormed potential concepts. Vivian proposed a race car theme,
                                    which I
                                    refined to model the enclosure after Lightning McQueen from Pixarâs Cars
                                    franchise.
                                    Given the complexity of modeling in Fusion360, I initiated the modeling process
                                    on
                                    February 13 to allow lots of time for refinement. Initially, I followed a <a
                                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voB4ggW-Gfg">tutorial</a> to guide the
                                    modeling process. The first step, which involved adding reference canvases in
                                    Fusion360,
                                    was beneficial. However, the remainder of the tutorial proved ineffective, as
                                    the
                                    resulting model failed to print correctly when converted to .3mf or .stl format.
                                    When
                                    sliced in PrusaSlicer, only support structures were generated, indicating an
                                    issue with
                                    model thickness. Attempts to add thickness resulted in the error message: âThe
                                    operation

                                    geometry.â The modelâs geometry was too complex to modify effectively,
                                    necessitating a
                                    complete restart. After further research, I located another tutorial that
                                    utilized the
                                    Chevrolet Corvette C6 orthographic diagrams as reference canvases; the same car
                                    model
                                    that inspired Lightning McQueenâs design. Following <a
                                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyqQtLjt_WM">this tutorial</a>, I
                                    successfully
                                    progressed through the initial steps until approximately the
                                    twelve-and-a-half-minute
                                    mark. At this stage, I encountered difficulties in creating accurate wheel holes
                                    due to
                                    differences in geometry between the tutorial model and my own. To address this
                                    challenge, I employed extruded cylinders to form the wheel holes, which proved
                                    to be an
                                    effective solution. After successfully incorporating this adjustment, I was able
                                    to
                                    extend the thickness of the car model without errors. The final model was
                                    successfully
                                    generated and appears as shown in the following image. I saved the .stl file and
                                    exported it to TinkerCad, where I could make more simple extrusions for the
                                    window
                                    shield, and McQueenâs signature number â95â on each side of the car. Then, I
                                    exported
                                    the .stl file to PrusaSlicer to scale it based on the measurements done in class
                                    and was
                                    about to slice it to make supports...</p>

                                    design
                                    issues with the chassis enclosure. The enclosure obstructed access to the
                                    battery
                                    compartment and power button, and the carâs spoiler contained unnecessary
                                    geometry.
                                    However, we determined that these issues could be effectively addressed through
                                    additional modifications. To implement these adjustments, we utilized TinkerCad
                                    to
                                    create targeted extrusions. First, we modified the front window by converting it
                                    into a
                                    complete extrusion, allowing users to access and remove the batteries. Next, we
                                    added a
                                    rotated cube extrusion at the rear of the car to provide access to the power
                                    button.
                                    Finally, we introduced a cylindrical extrusion to eliminate the unnecessary
                                    geometry in
                                    the spoiler. These modifications successfully resolved the identified issues
                                    while
                                    maintaining the integrity of the overall design.</p>

                                    a solid starting point, it was not the correct size. The model was too short and
                                    lacked
                                    sufficient width, and the wheel holes did not extend over the body of the car as
                                    intended. To address these issues, Vivian and I adjusted the modelâs dimensions
                                    based on
                                    the tailored box (yellow) we had created. We increased the modelâs length and

                                    few millimeters, ensuring that it was wider and slightly shorter than the yellow

                                    However, modifying the height presented a challenge, as any adjustments risked

                                    decided to scale the height of the model and incorporate cylindrical extrusions

                                    TinkerCad. Initially, the design appeared unrefined due to an overhanging

                                    excess material. To address this issue, we added a 2mm-wide semicircle to each
                                    overhanging section, effectively minimizing its visibility. Satisfied with the

                                    design, we proceeded with the standard preparation process. We inverted the

                                    dimensions
                                    specified in the computer model. This discrepancy was likely due to the
                                    endpoints being
                                    positioned at the spoiler. To correct this issue, we established a new target
                                    length
                                    based on precise measurements. Using a digital caliper, we measured the actual
                                    length of
                                    the tailored box (109.71 mm), the intended input length for the second print
                                    (108.54
                                    mm), and the actual length of the second print (106.48 mm). We then calculated
                                    the
                                    adjusted input length using the following equation: New Input Length=109.71
                                    mm+108.54
                                    mmâ106.48 mm=111.77 mm This revised length was used as the new input dimension
                                    for the
                                    next iteration of the print.</p>

                                <p class="text-center">The third print somewhat successfully addressed the length
                                    discrepancy, aligning with the intended dimensions for width and height, and
                                    while not
                                    perfect regarding length, it could still fit well enough for the chassis to
                                    function.
                                    The modelâs width and height remained consistent with the tailored box, and the
                                    wheel
                                    holes extended over the body of the car as intended. The revised design
                                    partially
                                    resolved the initial issues, resulting in a mostly functional and aesthetically

                                    chassis enclosure. This outcome demonstrates the importance of precise

                                    iterative adjustments in the design process.</p>

                                    enclosure, we
                                    began making our laser-cut chassis enclosure by brainstorming ideas for what we
                                    would
                                    make. After some thought, we settled on designing a <a
                                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_home">mobile house</a>. We
                                    sketched out
                                    how we would design it, agreeing on by making a wooden box reminiscent of the
                                    one in the
                                    tutorial, then adding two triangles to serve as a way to hang the roof panels,
                                    and, of
                                    course, two roof panels. </p>

                                <p class="text-center">Our first laser cut (not pictured) was supposed to look like
                                    this,
                                    but when we tried to scale in Fusion360 to match the chassisâ perimiter, it
                                    messed up
                                    the scale of the connecting joints and holes, so we could not connect it. To fix
                                    this,
                                    we decided to remake the chassis box in Fusion360, except this time, instead of
                                    directly
                                    following the tutorial's measurements, we would use our measurements of the
                                    chassis.
                                    This method proved to be effective, as our new box could now be properly
                                    assembled. </p>

                                    the fact
                                    that our roof panels were too long. We concluded that the best way to fix this
                                    would be
                                    to make a line in LightBurn to cut the unneded 'tiles'. After the cut, we were
                                    able to
                                    successfully assemble the full house and put it onto the chassis (pictured).</p>

                    <p>For Project 4: Open Source Assistive Technology, I took a dive into the world of open-source
                        technologies, more specifically, e-NABLE Community Foundationâs second iteration of the
                        Phoenix
                        Hand. By navigating through the e-NABLE community hub, I was able to create and assemble a
                        3D-printed prosthetic hand, all with the help of my project partner, <a href="
                            https://www.linkedin.com/in/erica-hwang-connect/">Erica Hwang</a>. With an approach that
                        could be
                        described as a
                        balance of divide-and-conquer and hands-on teamwork, we were able to use our strengths and
                        weaknesses to work together to create a Phoenix v2 hand, all the while learning a lot about
                        rapid
                        prototyping for assistive devices.

                    <h3 class="mb-0">4.1: Reviewing Documentation</h3>
                    <p>To begin Project 4, I started by navigating through both the e-NABLE hubâs <a href="
                            https://hub.e-nable.org/p/devices?p=Phoenix+v2+Hand"> Phoenix v2 Hand page</a> as well as
                        e-NABLEâs
                        page
                        on <a href="https://3d.nih.gov/collections/prosthetics"> NIH 3D Print Exchange.</a>
                        Navigating
                        through both pages
                        was not too difficult, as each page only took a few user inputs to get to the correct
                        destination.
                        Ultimately, though, I chose to use the e-NABLE hubâs direct page, as their page makes it
                        easier to
                        access all of the necessary information needed to assemble the hand (.stl files, video
                        tutorials,
                        .pdf tutorials, etc.). This is mainly because it takes more user inputs (searches, clicks,
                        keyboard
                        inputs) to access all the proper materials on the NIH page than the e-NABLE hub. A little
                        difference
                        like this can go a long way.

                        After choosing the e-NABLE hub to be my base of information for assembling the hand, I had
                        to choose
                        which instructions to follow: a video tutorial or a .pdf instruction manual. I ended up
                        using both
                        the .pdf instructions and multiple video tutorials, as both had their strengths and
                        weaknesses. For
                        example, I found that the .pdf instruction manual was better for more general instructions
                        such as
                        what parts we needed to use and how to make simple assembly maneuvers. The videos, on the
                        other
                        hand,
                        were better for more precise instructions, as the creators of each video went pretty slow in
                        assembling their Phoenix v2 Hands, which proved especially useful for stringing the joints,
                        which
                        required detailed instructions and precise assembly maneuvers. A suggestion for both could
                        be more
                        labels in each video, and more precise instructions for the stringing in the .pdf manual.

                    <p>To begin the assembly process, I downloaded the parts in the form of .stl files from the
                        e-NABLE
                        community page for the Phoenix v2 hand. My next objective was to scale the parts at a 150%
                        size,
                        since at 100% scale, the Phoenix v2 hand would be too small to fit an able-bodied adultâs
                        hand.
                        While this proved to be more of an inconvenience rather than a challenge, the real challenge
                        came
                        from fitting all the scaled parts within a limited number of Prusa MINI+ 3D Printer build
                        plates. At
                        first, I tried to fit all of the scaled parts within three plates in PrusaSlicer, but I
                        (along with
                        everyone else assembling their own Phoenix v2 hand at 150% scale) realized that it would be
                        impossible to additionally generate supports for each part, as there would be overlap.
                        Therefore, I
                        settled for an efficient four-plate print. After some additional time spent moving parts
                        around in
                        PrusaSlicer, I was able to come up with the layout as seen above.

                        The assembly process was relatively smooth. Initially, we used the .pdf instruction manual,
                        as most
                        of the steps in the first few stages were straightforward and did not require a video. When
                        we got
                        to stringing the fingers, however, we switched to looking at multiple videos, as the .pdf
                        instructions did not provide a comprehensive enough guide for how to do the stringing. Even
                        though
                        we had a video, this step proved to be challenging, as sometimes we would tie one too many
                        knots on
                        a finger, use the wrong screw, or choose to insert a string with the wrong length.

                    <p>
                        Regardless of these setbacks, we were able to persevere through the design process and
                        complete our
                        assembly of a functional 3D-printed Phoenix v2 prosthetic hand at 150% scale! See the video

                        Although the hand was complete, my job was not finished. My next task was to sketch and
                        create an
                        extension for the Phoenix v2 prosthetic hand. I quickly decided I wanted to make a
                        Spider-Man web
                        shooter to attach on top of the gripper box, but how would I do that? First, I created a
                        sketch of
                        my design and decided I would make a holder for a can of <a

                            Web Fluid</a> (silly string). It would then be attached to a trigger, which is attached
                        to a
                        string tied to the middle and ring fingers. When the wrist is bent and the middle and ring
                        fingers
                        go down, the string is pulled, pushing the trigger, which releases the web fluid.

                        To be completely honest, because I did not have access to a computer with Fusion 360 when I
                        had the
                        time to make my design, I had to model my web-slinger in TinkerCAD, as it is a web
                        application. The
                        modeling went alright, though there was one problem I faced: how could I have the lever be
                        pushed
                        back when the string is attached to the lever? I thought about it for a while, and even
                        considered a
                        backwards web-launcher, when I realized that the most optimal course of action would be to
                        scrap the
                        string tied to the trigger, and instead have it go over the trigger, so that when the string
                        tightens due to flexing of the wrist, the trigger would be pressed and web-fluid would
                        shoot.

                        This project highlighted the power of open-source assistive technology and the role of
                        inclusive
                        design in fostering accessibility, adaptability, and community-driven innovation. Through
                        assembling
                        the Phoenix v2 prosthetic hand and designing an extension, I gained a deeper appreciation
                        for rapid
                        prototyping as a tool for empowering individuals with limb differences. e-NABLEâs
                        collaborative
                        model aligns with Microsoftâs Inclusive Design principles by recognizing diversity as a
                        strength,
                        embracing iterative design, and actively seeking feedback from end users to refine
                        solutions.
                        Sara Hendren discusses in What Can a Body Do?, assistive technology should not only restore
                        function
                        but also embrace the creativity and agency of those who use it. My experience creating a
                        Spider-Man
                        web shooter extension reinforced the idea that prosthetic devices can be more than just
                        functional,
                        they can also be expressive and personalized. Ultimately, this project underscored the
                        ethical
                        responsibility designers have in ensuring that technology is not only accessible but also
                        meaningful
                        and engaging for those who rely on it.

                    <p>The four of us had a great time conducting each interview, despite the fact that only two or
                        three of us were at each interview due to the inevitable scheduling conflict. However, the
                        limited number of interviewers proved to be beneficial, as a maximum of three interviewers
                        per interview meant everyone was doing something, as one person would always be taking
                        notes, while the remainder of people would be asking questions. As for the content of the
                        interviews, they all went smoothly, as each interviewee seemed excited about the potential
                        of our projects and willing to help. We were able to get a much better understanding of what
                        its like having a visual impairment or working with people with visual impairments from
                        multiple perspectives.</p>

                    <p> Although our interviews took slightly longer to conduct, we had already completed extensive
                        research and brainstorming beforehand. This preparation enabled us to efficiently arrange
                        the insights and identify key themes: Tactile Features & Sensory Elements, Navigation &
                        Movement, and Fixed Reference Points. Using these three themes, we were able to create
                        insight statements, which are statements that translate raw data into meaningful findings in
                        the pursuit of innovation. They are of upmost importance because mportant because they help
                        organizations understand consumer motivations, uncover unmet needs, and identify
                        opportunities for improvement.

                    <p><b>How might we</b> point out the most salient features of the Brandeis campus in a way that
                        makes use of clear labeling, high contrast, and texture variation in our design?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use different fabrics and 3D-printed surfaces in our tactile map to create a variety of
                            textures</li>
                        <li>Add elevated blocks to indicate stairs</li>
                        <li>Focus on academic buildings and support centers rather than other infrastructure (such
                            as out-of-the-way housing and athletics facilities)</li>
                        <li>Incorporate multiple labeling systems for different protocols</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4 class="mb-0" style="margin-top: 25px;">Navigation & Movement</h4>
                    <p><b>How might we</b> improve the ability for people to navigate the Brandeis campus,
                        especially those with visual impairments, so that everyone is on an equitable plane when
                        moving around? </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create our maps with distinct textures and place them around campus</li>
                        <li>Map smaller sections of the Brandeis campus that can be carried by the student with them
                            (compared to the stationary map)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4 class="mb-0" style="margin-top: 25px;">Fixed Reference Points</h4>
                    <p><b>How might we</b> incorporate landmarks and indicate entrances of buildings into our
                        overall design?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use a different texture on the buildings to include the most accessible entrance or
                            indicating it in braille/with a symbol </li>
                        <li>Add a "you are here" symbol with a distinct texture</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="mb-0">Storyboard</h3>
                    <p>After brainstorming and creating our insight statements, we concluded that creating a master
                        map to be put on campus would be the best way to go about executing our vision. Based on our
                        feedback, we would focus on:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Academic buldings, accesibke dorm rooms, and dining halls</li>
                        <li>Making use of high visual and texture contrast</li>
                        <li>Emphasizing where the enterances to buildings are</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We plan to bring our vision to life by using a mixture of 3D printing and laser cutting, as
                        well as added materials for texture. We also made a storyboard to show how a potential user
                        would interact with our product, as seen below:</p>

                    <p>After presenting our storyboard to our classmates, we recieved some helpful feedback from
                        them to inform our design process. The summarized feedback is shown below: </p>

                    </div>
                    <p>For our first prototype, we created two products: a laser-cut map of Massell Quad and a
                        Braille calibration test. Using TouchMapper, we generated a digital map and converted it
                        into an SVG compatible with Lightburn. We manually added buildings to scale and chose to
                        laser-etch the paths for tactile clarity.

                        the Braille callibration test was printed in three sizes: 1.7 mm, 1.6 mm, and 1.5 mm. Later,
                        we met with Elana to test both items. She liked the etched paths but recommended making the
                        roads thicker. For the Braille, she preferred the 1.7 mm size, with the 1.6 mm still
                        readable, while the 1.5 mm was too small. Weâll be using the 1.7 mm size going forward and
                        are excited to keep working with Elana on refining our final design!</p>

                            maps
                            are necessary societal tools. It goes into the history of tactile maps, detailing when
                            they were
                            first created in the 1800s and how they evolved as time went on. It debunks the
                            suggestion that
